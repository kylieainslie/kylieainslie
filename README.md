### Bio
👋 Hello there, 

I’m Kylie Ainslie, and I’m an infectious disease modeller at the 
[Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)](https://www.rivm.nl/en) 
and an [Honorary Assistant Professor at the University of Hong Kong School of Public Health](https://sph.hku.hk). My work at RIVM 
focuses on using mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to determine the impact of vaccination strategies on 
disease spread, and the development of statistical methods to determine how vaccine-induced protection wanes over time. At the 
University of Hong Kong my work focuses on determining the real world protection provided by vaccines against respiratory diseases, 
such as COVID-19 and influenza. I strongly believe in open-source and reproducible research and love coding in R, so you'll find code 
for my different projects here. For a more detailed bio and info about all the projects I'm working on, head over to 
[my website](kylieainslie.github.io).
