### Bio
👋 Hello there, 

I’m Kylie Ainslie, and I'm Modelling for Policy Lead in the [Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Melbourne](https://medicine.unimelb.edu.au/school-structure/infectious-diseases), based at the [Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity](https://www.doherty.edu.au/), and an [Honorary Assistant Professor at the University of Hong Kong School of Public Health](https://sph.hku.hk). My work at the University of Melbourne focuses on using mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to inform public health policy decisions. At the University of Hong Kong, my work focuses on determining the real-world protection provided by vaccines against respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 and influenza. I strongly believe in open-source and reproducible research and love coding in R, so you'll find code for my different projects here. For a more detailed bio and info about all the projects I'm working on, head over to [my website](kylieainslie.github.io).
